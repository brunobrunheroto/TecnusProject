# Tecnus Project

<p>Together, Gamelab and Tecnus structured this digital platform to facilitate technological education in a didactic way. Gamelab, Facamp's institution, was responsible for the creation of the platform and quizzes, while Tecnus, a project of Enactus Facamp, made the content available. In this way, we seek to deliver the best quality teaching to our students.</p>
